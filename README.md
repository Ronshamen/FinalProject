# MY FINAL PROJECT in 

## AUTOMATION TESTING

This project was created to show the knowledge I acquired during the 
"full stack Automation" course I just finished.   

This Project was written in Java, using the following frameworks: 
* Selenium for Automation with WebDriverManager 
* TestNg for testing  
* Appuim Studio For mobile testing

My project supports testing on different platforms - web, mobile, Api, Electron And Desktop apps which u can test individually using Jenkins.  
Reports are sent to Allure Reports.
